# Climate Change Analyzer

Climate Change Analyzer is a Java porgram that analyzes 40,000 entries of data realating to the change of climate countries. The data in world_temp_2000-2016.csv has the average temperature of all major countries in the world from 2000 to 2016. The program reads the data from the .csv file and parses the information based on country, then writes the results of the data found to another .csv file. The data found is based on user input. The user is asked for the desired country name, month and year then writes the data to the file deignated for that task. Methods were created to show:

- The month of a specified country that had the lowest and highest temperature
- The year of a specified country that had the lowest and highest temperature
- The lowest and highest temperature overall of a given country
- The top 10 countries with the lowest temperatures
- The top 10 countries with the highest temperatures
- All months of all countries within a given temperature range
- The top 10 countries with the highest change in temperature between two given years

### Concepts demonstrated
1. File I/O
2. Traversing large data files 
3. Using data structures to store large data files
4. Inheritance
5. Impelementation of interfaces

## Results
The result of this program is that users are able to see the effect of global warming on different countries through the change in average temperature per country.
